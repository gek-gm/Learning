Order.java
1 - Method writeOrder is too long, multiple Extract Method must be applied
2 - unused variable (lines 108,111)
3 - Query on line 113 is wrong
4 - Method getTotal() seems to be more interested in processing data of class "lineItemList",  "Move Method" could be an option, "Extract method" another one
5 - lineItemList looks like a useless wrapper for a Vector of lineItem, "Lazy Class"
6 - saveOrder method does too much, the connection creation should be delegated to another class
7 - Method WriteOrder and getTotal contain duplicated code
8 - Too many comments
9 - hashCode not implemented
