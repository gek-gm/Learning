Order.java
1 - [Long Method] - Method writeOrder is too long, multiple Extract Method must be applied
2 - unused variable (lines 108,111)
3 - Query on line 113 is wrong
4 - [Feature Envy] - Method getTotal() seems to be more interested in processing data of class "lineItemList",  "Move Method"/"Extract Method" must be applied
5 - [Lazy Class] - lineItemList looks like a useless wrapper for a Vector of lineItem, "Lazy Class"
6 - [Divergent Change] - saveOrder method does too much, the connection creation should be delegated to another class, the method setConnection should be delegated to another class
7 - [Duplicated code] - Method WriteOrder and getTotal contain duplicated code
8 - [Comment] - Too many comments
9 - equals overridden, hashCode not
10 - writeOrder method takes order as parameter, define it static or print the current instance order

lineItem.java
1 - [Inconsistent Names] - all methods and variable names inconsistent
2 - [Unused property/methods] - class contains a Vector of itself as a property ???
3 - Inconsistent visibility modifiers
4 - unitPrice type set as int

All
Variable names conventions not consistent
